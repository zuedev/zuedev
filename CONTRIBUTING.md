# Contributing to `zuedev` projects on GitHub

Hello! zuedev here. Want to contribute to any of my projects? Awesome! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

All of my actively-maintained projects are hosted on my [personal git server](https://git.zue.dev/), then mirrored to GitHub. Due to this, there are different ways to contribute depending on the project.

## If the project <ins>**is**</ins> hosted on my personal git server

Please do not push directly to the repository. Instead, format your changes using [`git format-patch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch) and send them to me via [email](mailto:git@zue.dev) or [Discord](https://discord.com/users/723361818940276736) in a patch file such as `0001-My-Change.patch`.

## If the project <ins>**is not**</ins> hosted on my personal git server

You can create a pull request on GitHub as usual. I will review it and merge it if everything looks good. Keep in mind that I may not be able to respond immediately to pull requests, so please be patient.
