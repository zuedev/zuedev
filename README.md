## Who am I? âœ¨</h2>

### Formally...

I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur from the UK who thrives on building things that help and entertain people.

If you want to learn more about me, check out my resume. In short:

- Software engineer (full-stack) for more than 12 years;
- Trusted with leadership for 9 of those years;
- Given directorship of a non-profit since 2023;
- Programming polyglot (JavaScript, Python, C#, and more);
- Running Linux (Arch), Windows, and macOS on a daily basis;
- Been living in the Unreal Engine for ~4 years;
- Started mentoring the next generation of developers in 2021;

### Informally...

I'm an avid gamer and a hobbyist musician in my spare time. On the weekends I can usually be found DM'ing games such as Dungeons & Dragons and Cyberpunk RED with my friends. I'm nearly always listening to music and programming something, probably working on my latest game or open-source project.
